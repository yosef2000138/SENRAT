üîç Project Description
This project combines financial news sentiment analysis with technical market indicators (specifically VWAP) to generate smart trading signals for Bitcoin (BTC/USD).
The system uses natural language processing (NLP) to analyze news headlines and determine if market sentiment is positive or negative. These insights are then used alongside the VWAP indicator to decide whether to buy or sell.

The interface provides:

Real-time BTC price tracking

VWAP comparison

Smart buy/sell signals based on AI

News sentiment scoring

Trade execution simulation

Portfolio tracking

The goal is to support more accurate and informed crypto trading decisions by integrating both market behavior and news-driven sentiment.
